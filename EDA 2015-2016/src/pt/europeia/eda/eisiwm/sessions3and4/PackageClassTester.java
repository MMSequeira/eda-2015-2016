 * to serve as a package of static members, including methods and
 * attributes. It is not a regular class, whose instances are used in
 * programs. Thus, it should not be instantiated. Actually, attempting to do
 * so will result in an error, since its constructor is declared to be
 * private. Also, it should not be extended. Attempting to do so will also
 * generate an error, since the class is declared to be final.
